## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.9+:** [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* **pip (Python Package Installer):** Comes with Python.
* **PostgreSQL:**
    * [Download PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
    * *Recommended (Docker):* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (for easily running PostgreSQL in a container)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ShaniWolfson/study-assistant-backend.git](https://github.com/ShaniWolfson/study-assistant-backend.git)
    cd study-assistant-backend
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    Using `pipenv` (recommended):
    ```bash
    pip install pipenv
    pipenv install
    pipenv shell
    ```

    Using `venv`:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt # (You'll create this file later)
    ```

3.  **Install project dependencies:**
    *(If using `pipenv`, this was done by `pipenv install`)*

    Create a `requirements.txt` file (if you didn't use pipenv or didn't have one initially) with the following content:
    ```
    fastapi
    uvicorn[standard]
    sqlalchemy
    psycopg2-binary
    python-dotenv
    passlib[bcrypt]
    python-jose[cryptography] # For JWTs (auth)
    # For AI (choose based on your preference):
    transformers # If using Hugging Face locally
    torch # Required by transformers for PyTorch models
    tensorflow # Required by transformers for TensorFlow models
    openai # If using OpenAI API
    # Optional (for migrations):
    alembic
    # Optional (for async tasks):
    celery
    redis # Celery broker
    ```
    Then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up PostgreSQL:**
    * Create a new PostgreSQL user and database for the project.
    * Example (using `psql`):
        ```sql
        CREATE USER study_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';
        CREATE DATABASE study_db OWNER study_user;
        ```
    * *If using Docker:*
        ```bash
        docker run --name study_postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=study_user -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_secure_password -e POSTGRES_DB=study_db -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
        ```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root of your `study-assistant-backend` directory and add the following environment variables. **Do not commit this file to Git.**

```dotenv
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://study_user:your_secure_password@localhost:5432/study_db"
SECRET_KEY="a_super_secret_key_for_jwt_and_security" # Generate a strong, random string
ALGORITHM="HS256" # For JWT
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30 # Or whatever duration you prefer for JWT tokens

# If using OpenAI API:
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"

# If using Hugging Face models locally (example, depends on model used):
# HF_MODEL_NAME="t5-small"
# HF_SUMMARIZATION_MODEL="t5-base"
# HF_QUESTION_GENERATION_MODEL="t5-base-qa" # Example, you'll pick a real one
Running the Application
Run database migrations (after setting up SQLAlchemy models):
(This step assumes you've set up Alembic, if not, you'll need to create your tables manually or through SQLAlchemy's create_all() for development.)

Bash

alembic upgrade head
Start the FastAPI application:

Bash

uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
(Assuming your main FastAPI application instance is named app in app/main.py)

The backend will typically be running on http://localhost:8000.

API Endpoints
(This section will be filled in as you develop your endpoints. Here are examples of what you might include):

Authentication
POST /auth/register: Register a new user.

POST /auth/token: Get an access token for a user (JWT).

GET /auth/me: Get current authenticated user's details.

Documents
POST /documents/: Upload/paste new text content. (Requires authentication)

GET /documents/: Get a list of all user's documents. (Requires authentication)

GET /documents/{document_id}: Get details of a specific document. (Requires authentication)

DELETE /documents/{document_id}: Delete a document. (Requires authentication)

AI Processing
POST /ai/process-document: Trigger AI processing (summarization, quiz, flashcards) for a document.

Request Body: {"document_id": int, "generate_summary": bool, "generate_quiz": bool, "generate_flashcards": bool}

Response: Status of the processing and potentially links to generated content.

GET /documents/{document_id}/summary: Retrieve the generated summary for a document.

GET /documents/{document_id}/quizzes: Retrieve quizzes generated from a document.

GET /documents/{document_id}/flashcards: Retrieve flashcards generated from a document.

Quizzes & Flashcards
GET /quizzes/{quiz_id}: Get a specific quiz with its questions and options.

POST /quizzes/{quiz_id}/submit-attempt: Submit a user's quiz attempt.

GET /flashcards/{flashcard_id}: Get a specific flashcard.

GET /flashcards/: Get all flashcards generated for the user.

Database Schema
(This section will contain the actual SQL schema or a visual representation of your database tables, similar to the conceptual one provided previously.)

See app/models.py (or equivalent) for the SQLAlchemy model definitions, which reflect the database schema.

AI Integration
The core AI functionality is handled within the backend. Depending on the chosen approach:

Hugging Face Transformers: Models are loaded and run locally on the server. This offers privacy and no per-request cost but requires more computational resources on your server.

OpenAI API: API calls are made to OpenAI's cloud services. This simplifies setup and scales well but incurs API usage costs.

Prompt engineering will be crucial for effective question and flashcard generation using Large Language Models (LLMs). The backend handles crafting these prompts and parsing the AI's responses.
